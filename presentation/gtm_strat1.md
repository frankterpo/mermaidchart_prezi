| What we’re building | For whom | How we win | First 6 months |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI Readiness Platform (maturity → roadmap) | Founders/CEOs + Product/Tech/Ops leaders at tech-first scale-ups | Practical execution (roadmap, templates, governance) > AI hype | Organic-only until repeatable loop |

----

### 0) Context & Goal
#### What we’re optimizing for (constraints-first)

| Constraint | Target | What it means for GTM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Launch date | Feb 2026 | We need fast feedback loops and tight execution |
| ICP | Founders/CEOs + Dept leads + Product/Tech leaders | Messaging must resonate with budget holders + implementers |
| Target business | Tech-first scale-ups | Channels cluster around operator/founder ecosystems |
| Pricing | £100–£200/month per business | Motion must be high-trust + low-friction + volume capable |
| ARR goal | £500k by end of 2026 | Build repeatable acquisition → then scale winners |
| Budget | Organic first 6 months | Spend only after conversion path is proven |

====

### North Star (first 6 months)
#### “Repeatable, measurable acquisition loop before paid”

| Step | What we do | What we measure (leading) | What we measure (lagging) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1) Distribute | Founder/operator content + community + targeted outreach | Impressions, saves, replies, DMs | Inbound volume by source |
| 2) Start conversations | Turn attention into DMs + calls | DM/reply rate, comment quality | Meetings booked |
| 3) Capture intent | Route to demo / Intercom / assessment | Form starts, assessment completes | MQL created |
| 4) Qualify | Classify + score in HubSpot | Speed-to-lead, completion rates | MQL→SQL |
| 5) Close | Clear close plan + success criteria | Proposal velocity | SQL→Close + cycle time |
| 6) Learn + recycle | Capture “why not” + reactivation | Reactivation engagement | Pipeline recovered |

----

### 1) Assumptions
#### Explicit so we can validate quickly (and kill what doesn’t work)

| Assumption | Why it’s reasonable | How we validate fast |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Buyers “live” on LinkedIn + X | That’s where founders/operators learn + discuss tools | Track DM→meeting rate by channel |
| Reddit/communities are selective add-ons | High signal only when implementation-heavy | Monitor thread-to-inbound conversion |
| Product wins by utility | Readiness = roadmap + templates + governance | Test “assets” vs “vision” messaging |
| Events can compress trust | In-person surfaces real use-cases quickly | Measure meetings + conversions post-event |
| Podcasts are leverage | Borrowed trust + concentrated B2B listeners | Track inbound spikes + assisted closes |
| Paid only after repeatability | Avoid scaling noise | Gate spend behind proven conversion path |

====

### “Think bootstrapped, then scale like venture”
#### The operating principle behind every channel choice

| Phase | Default posture | What we invest | What we avoid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Months 0–6 | Organic-first | Time + craft + distribution + instrumentation | Broad paid, heavy tooling overhead |
| After repeatability | Scale winners | Controlled paid (retargeting, ICP sponsorships) | Spending without attribution + conversion proof |

----

### 2) Research Approach (first 2 weeks)
#### How we research, validate, and choose channels + messaging

| Track | What we do | Data sources | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Voice-of-customer (VOC) | 15–25 short interviews across ICP roles | Calls + notes + shared language | Triggers, objections, “words they use” |
| Social listening | Track founder/operator conversations | LinkedIn + X + selective Reddit | Keyword map + content backlog |
| Competitive/adjacent scan | Map how alternatives position | Competitors, consultancies, maturity assessments | Gaps + differentiation angles |
| Internal instrumentation | UTM discipline → HubSpot fields | Website/Intercom + HubSpot | Source→conversion→cycle time by channel |

====

### VOC (what we’re extracting)
#### The outputs that directly power GTM execution

| What we capture | Why it matters | Example you can say in the room |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger moments | What causes urgent buying | “Tools everywhere, no roadmap.” “Board pressure.” “Security concerns.” |
| Objections | What blocks conversion | “No proof yet.” “Not this quarter.” “Unclear ROI.” |
| Persona nuance | Same pain, different framing | CTO = governance risk; Founder = speed + control; Ops = adoption + process |
| Success criteria | How they define “worked” | “One roadmap, clear owners, measurable adoption in 30 days.” |
| Pricing sensitivity | How £100–£200 lands | “Fast ROI / low risk / easy to approve.” |

====

### Message Map (per persona)
#### Pain → Promise → Proof → CTA (kept simple, repeatable)

| Persona | Pain (verbatim) | Promise (30 days) | Proof (asset) | CTA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founder/CEO | “We’re behind; no plan.” | “Clear adoption roadmap + owners.” | Readiness score + roadmap template | 10-min assessment |
| CTO | “Risk + sprawl + no standards.” | “Governance starter + approved stack.” | Policy kit + guardrails checklist | Book a technical walkthrough |
| Head of Product | “Inconsistent productivity.” | “Workflow adoption plan + measurement.” | Use-case library + rollout plan | Request demo |
| Ops/RevOps | “Ad hoc tooling, no process.” | “Operating rhythm + playbooks.” | KPI dashboard template | Get the checklist |

----

### 3) Channel Strategy (organic-first)
#### Where we prioritise (and why)

::img{src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/linkedin/0A66C2"}
::img{src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/x/000000"}
::img{src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/reddit/FF4500"}

| Priority | Channel | Why this channel | What we run (examples) | What “success” looks like |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | LinkedIn | Founders/operators + best targeting | Weekly “AI Readiness teardown” + targeted outreach | DM→meeting rate + demo requests |
| 1 | X | Fast feedback + founder network | Short frameworks + operator snippets | Replies/DMs + assisted inbound |
| 2 | Selective communities | Peer validation + real implementation threads | Answer threads + offer usable assets | Thread→assessment completion |
| 3 | Events (selective) | Trust compresses; use-cases surface | 1–2 targeted events + on-site discovery | Meetings + faster closes |
| 3 (edge) | Hackathons | High-signal adopters experimenting | Sponsor/attend selectively | Champions + referrals |
| 4 | Podcasts | Borrowed trust to B2B audience | Lead with assets (index/checklist) | Warm inbound + assisted closes |
| Later | Paid | Amplify winners only | Retargeting + ICP sponsorships | CAC stable + predictable |

====

### LinkedIn: how we execute (Sales Navigator)
#### Precision targeting + message testing without guessing

| Step | What we do | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1) Build ICP lists | Use Sales Nav: title, seniority, geography, company stage | Target lists by persona |
| 2) Test 3 message angles | (a) Roadmap (b) Governance (c) Productivity | Reply-rate by angle |
| 3) Convert via assets | Offer checklist/assessment before “demo” | Higher intent, lower friction |
| 4) Log everything | UTM + source fields into HubSpot | True attribution |

====

### Content engine (Ghost → repurpose)
#### Low-cost, compounding distribution (your proven play)

::img{src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/ghost/15171A"}

| Asset | Where it lives | How we repurpose | Why it works |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Newsletter (bi-weekly) | Ghost | Turn into LinkedIn posts + X threads | Compounds trust + consistent touchpoints |
| Blog (SEO) | Ghost | Pull snippets + visuals into social | Captures “search intent” + geo/SEO |
| Use-case stories | Ghost + social | Operator snippets (video) | Higher engagement + memorability |
| “Teardown” series | LinkedIn/X | Weekly cadence | Clear utility + repeatable format |

----

### 4) GTM Plan & Funnel Design (TOFU → MOFU → BOFU)
#### Simple, measurable, coordinated

::img{src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/hubspot/FF7A59"}
::img{src="https://cdn.simpleicons.org/slack/4A154B"}

| Funnel stage | Objective | Entry points | Primary tool | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TOFU | Create conversations + capture intent | Website demo form, Intercom, DMs, assessment | Website/Intercom | High-intent actions |
| MOFU | Classify, nurture, qualify | HubSpot lifecycle + sequences | HubSpot | MQL → SQL |
| BOFU | Close with clear success plan | Use-case mapping + timeline | HubSpot | Closed-won / Closed-lost |
| Reactivation | Re-enter at budget window | ~90-day loop | HubSpot | Pipeline recovery |

====

### Lead classification (technical logic)
#### New vs Returning vs Reactivated (and why it matters)

| Lead type | Definition | Why it matters | What we trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New inbound | Unknown contact/company | Needs education + fit check | Standard nurture sequence |
| Returning inbound | Known, not closed-lost/churned | Higher trust, faster qualification | Fast-track sequence |
| Reactivated | Previously closed-lost/churned | Timing/budget likely changed | Reactivation sequence + “what changed?” |

====

### Sequences + Slack alerts (coordination)
#### HubSpot runs the system; Slack executes it

| Trigger | HubSpot rule | Slack alert | Owner action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Demo request | Form submit | #gtm-hot-leads | Respond < 1 hour |
| Assessment complete | Score generated | #gtm-hot-leads | Route by persona |
| Deal stalled | No activity X days | Owner ping | Restart sequence |
| Reactivation | Closed-lost returns | Reactivation queue | Qualify “what changed” |
| High-intent DM | Logged activity | Owner ping | Book meeting |

====

### Reactivation cadence (~90 days)
#### Why 3 months (your rationale, tightened)

| Why 90 days works | What we send | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Often aligns with budget reconsiderations + renewal rhythms | “What changed since last time?” + updated asset | Recover pipeline efficiently |
| Keeps brand present without spam | 1 useful update + 1 clear ask | Restart conversation |
| Lets us bring new proof | Index/benchmark, new template, new milestone | Increase conversion odds |

----

### 5) Execution System (week-by-week)
#### How we coordinate multiple workstreams without heavy tooling

| Layer | What we use | Why (startup reality) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CRM + attribution | HubSpot | Source of truth + measurable funnel |
| Execution + speed | Slack | Fast handoffs + hot lead routing |
| Light automation | Google Apps Script | Avoid early n8n/Zapier cost/complexity |
| Content + SEO | Ghost | Newsletter + blog + repurposing engine |

====

### First 6–8 weeks (playbook)
#### Practical schedule founders can believe

| Week | Focus | Deliverables | Decision gates |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–2 | Research sprint | VOC + message maps + asset backlog | Pick 2–3 angles |
| 3–4 | Ship assets + distribution | Checklist + assessment + teardown format | Track DM→meeting |
| 5–6 | Funnel tightening | HubSpot lifecycle + sequences + alerts | Improve speed + conversion |
| 7–8 | Channel focus | Double down on best channel/message | Kill low-signal plays |

----

### 6) Budget Allocation (organic-first)
#### Time is budget; spend follows proof

| Budget type | What we invest first | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time | Content + conversations + community presence | Highest leverage early |
| Minimal tools | HubSpot basics + Ghost + Slack | Enough to measure + execute |
| Selective travel | 1–2 events | Compress trust, harvest use-cases |
| Paid | Only after repeatability | Avoid scaling noise |

====

### When (and why) we introduce paid
#### Gate spend behind repeatability

| Condition | Proof we need | First paid tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Channel repeatability | Inbound consistently from one channel | Retargeting high-intent visitors |
| Message repeatability | One angle reliably converts to SQL | Small ICP sponsorships |
| Predictable economics | Directional CAC/LTV confidence | Scale slowly, keep attribution clean |

----

### 7) Metrics & Success Measurement
#### What we track to validate success (simple + rigorous)

| Metric layer | KPIs | What it answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Leading indicators | Impressions, saves, replies, DMs, assessment completes, form starts | “Is it resonating?” |
| Funnel health | MQL→SQL, SQL→Close, cycle time, speed-to-lead | “Is it converting?” |
| Revenue truth | Pipeline created by source, ARR, assisted closes | “Is it working?” |
| Retention signals (post-purchase) | Activation + repeat usage | “Will it stick?” |

====

### Attribution discipline (HubSpot truth)
#### “Definitive metric: what lands in HubSpot as attributable pipeline + revenue”

| Must-have field | Why it matters | How we enforce it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source + UTM | Channel truth | Required on create |
| Persona | Correct routing | Lifecycle rules |
| Lead type | New/returning/reactivated | Automated classification |
| Close reason | Learning loop | Mandatory on closed-lost |
| Cycle time | Speed as advantage | Auto-calculated |

----

### 8) Creative “get noticed” plays
#### Low-cost, high talkability (bonus points)

| Play | What it is | Why it spreads | What it drives |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI Readiness Index (quarterly) | Benchmarks from assessments (anonymised) | Shareable proof + authority | Warm inbound |
| Teardown series | “Why rollouts fail + 30-day fix” | Practical + repeatable | Consistent pipeline |
| Operator-first assets | Templates: policy, roadmap, KPIs | People save + forward | High intent captures |
| Founder story content | Build-in-public lessons + culture | Trust compounds (Cursor/Rio effect) | Brand pull |

====

### Events wedge (your example, tightened)
#### “Go where buyers concentrate, even if unsexy”

| Example | Principle | How we apply it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Briefcase: UK accountant conferences | Buyer density beats “coolness” | Pick 1–2 targeted events where AI adoption pressure is real |
| Hackathons (selective) | High-signal builders | Show up where teams are actively experimenting and need structure |
| Outcome | Use-cases + language + champions | Feed content backlog + speed up closes |

----

### 9) Why I can execute this (credibility)
#### Evidence from past operator work (kept factual)

| Capability | What I’ve done | How it helps Dragonfly |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inbound engine | Scaled a newsletter motion to 18,000 subscribers | Low-cost distribution + compounding trust |
| Repurposing | Ghost newsletter → blog → LinkedIn/X | Content efficiency + SEO/geo benefits |
| ICP targeting | Used Sales Nav filters for CXOs/decision makers | Precision outreach + message testing |
| Outbound lists | Built actionable lists from targeting | Repeatable outbound experiments |
| Content that triggers DMs | Landscape tables + stakeholder mentions | Engagement → conversations |
| Partnerships | Relationships with ETN + The Venture Show | Fast access to B2B audiences |

----

### Close (15 seconds)
#### How I’d summarise to founders + Head of Ops

| Line | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | “Start with VOC + listening to extract triggers, language, and objections—then build message maps per persona.” |
| 2 | “Ship practical assets (score/roadmap/policy) and distribute where decision-makers already live (LinkedIn + X, selective communities).” |
| 3 | “Capture and classify everything in HubSpot, run sequences with Slack alerts, measure conversion + cycle time, and scale only what repeats—paid later.” |
